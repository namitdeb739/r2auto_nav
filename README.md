# The 'Elevator' Problem: S/Ue

This repository was developed for NUS AY23/24 S2 EG2310. It includes navigation & communications code written for a TurtleBot 3 operating on ROS2, called **S/Ue**, because this module gave us so much emotional trauma that S/U-ing is the only logical choice.

**To anyone taking this module, good luck.**

## Description

The mission requires developing an integrated robot system which can autonomously navigate through a randomised maze, up until an 'elevator lobby' right after the exit.

In the lobby, the robot is to send an HTTP request to a web server, which will trigger a random 1 of 2 doors top open.The server will also send a JSON response to the robot ID-ing the correct door.

The robot will then proceed to the door and locate a bucked in a randomised location on the other side. From there, it will release 5 ping pong balls into the bucket.

Finally, the robot will return to the maze develop a full map of the area using SLAM.

**NOTE**: Use of this repository requires the phsyical assembly of S/Ue. Installation instructions below are specific for the Remote PC. Full hardware & technical documentation can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/namitdeb739/r2auto_nav/tree/main/documentation) folder.

## Getting Started

### Software Dependencies

* Ubuntu 20.04

### Installing

#### Install ROS2 Foxy on Remote PC

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros2_foxy.sh
sudo chmod 755 ./install_ros2_foxy.sh
bash ./install_ros2_foxy.sh
```

#### Install Dependent ROS2 packages

Install Gazebo

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-gazebo-*
```

Install Cartogrpaher

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-cartographer
sudo apt install ros-foxy-cartographer-ros
```

Install Navigation2

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-navigation2
sudo apt install ros-foxy-nav2-bringup
```

Install Slam Toolbox

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-slam-toolbox
```

#### Install TurtleBot3 Packages

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
sudo apt install ros-foxy-dynamixel-sdk
sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3-msgs
sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3
```

#### Configure Environment for ROS2 Develoopment

```bash
echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Create Aliases

For ease of use, we have created the following aliases which we have added to the `~/.bashrc` of our Remote PC and RPi4. We have listed them below.

**Note**: For our mission we had setup an AWS server which allows us to fetch the RPi4's IP-address whenever `sshrp` was called.

| Remote PC Alias | Command |
| :---------------- | :------ |
| `sshrp` | `ssh ubuntu@<RPi4 IP-address>` |
| `toolbox` | `ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py`|
| `rvm` | `cd ~/.rviz2 && rviz --display-config mission.rviz`|
| `ctl` | `cd ~/colcon_ws && colcon build --packages-select auto_nav && cd ~/colcon_ws/src/auto_nav/auto_nav && ros2 run auto_nav control` |
| `exp` | `cd ~/colcon_ws && colcon build --packages-select auto_nav && cd ~/colcon_ws/src/auto_nav/auto_nav && ros2 run auto_nav explore` |
| `rteleop` | `ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard` |

| RPi4 Alias | Command |
| :---------------- | :------ |
| `rosbu`        |   `ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py`    |
| `line` | `cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src && colcon build --packages-select r2auto_nav && source install/setup.bash && ros2 run r2auto_nav l` |

#### Setting Up RViz Environment

Run Slam Toolbox

```bash
toolbox
```

Open RViz

```bash
rviz
```

Add the following Nodes:

* Map
* LaserScan
* Marker Array
* Interactive Markers

`File`>`Save Config` and save to the default directory, `~/.rviz`, named as `mission.rviz` (So that this configuration launches upon calling `rvm`)

### Executing program

Place S/Ue on the starting line.

Terminal 1: Bringup the TurtleBot

```bash
sshrp
rosbu
```

Terminal 2: Launch slam

```bash
toolbox
```

Terminal 3: Launch RViz

```bash
rvm
```

Terminal 4: Run `control.py` or `explore.py`,

```bash
ctl
# OR
exp
```

Terminal 5: Run `lineFollower.py`

```bash
sshrp
cd turtlebot3_ws/src/r2auto_nav/r2auto_nav/
python3 lineFollower.py
```

S/Ue should then proceed to execute the mission.

## Troubleshooting

* To test S/Ue's movement independently, use `rteleop` to manually control movement.
* To test payload execution, run `python3 payload.py`.
